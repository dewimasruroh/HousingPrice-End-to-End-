## Housing Price Prediction End-to-End

This project will guide you through the process of building a machine learning model for predicting housing prices and deploying it using Streamlit. This is my first full, complete project, and the goal is to walk you through how to do it correctly in the simplest way possible, making it beginner-friendly. In a future project, I will share how to improve your predictions and go deeper into the technical aspects.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python and Machine Learning
- Jupyter Notebook for the code and model training
- Mac M1 environment setup

### Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Finish your code and export the model:**
   - In Jupyter Notebook, complete the machine learning code.
   - Export the trained model to a `.pkl` file using `pickle`.

2. **Set up your development environment in VSCode:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code and set up your project folder.

3. **Set up the requirements:**
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file with the necessary libraries for the project.

4. **Set up the virtual environment:**
   - Run the following commands to set up your virtual environment:
     - `python -m venv venv`
     - `source venv/bin/activate`
     - `which python` (to verify that Python is ready)

5. **Install the necessary libraries:**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all libraries listed in the `requirements.txt`.

6. **Check installed libraries:**
   - Run `pip list` to ensure that all required libraries have been installed.

7. **Create your Streamlit deployment script:**
   - Write the `streamlit.py` file where the code for the deployment will go.

8. **Test your Streamlit web application:**
   - Run the following command to test your web deployment:
     - `streamlit run streamlit.py`
   - If the app opens successfully in your browser, it's ready to go!

9. **Styling and finishing touches:**
   - Feel free to decorate and style your web page as desired to enhance the user experience.

### Next Steps

After completing this, you'll have a fully functional web app for housing price prediction. In future tutorials, I will dive deeper into improving the accuracy of your predictions and the technical aspects of machine learning.
